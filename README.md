## Objective

Design an interactive quiz that uses an existing API for questions and answers.
The project should run in a CLI, deployed via Heroku, using Python.

***The needs within this project are not genuine and are made purely
for the purpose of completing my Code Institute project***

***

## Brief

### **C**omputer **L**iterate **I**nvestigation

The goal of this site is to provide an interactive quiz with increasing
difficulty levels. The final product should:

- be programmatically error free
- be written using Python
- have a varied question base to allow replayability
- handle all user input errors gracefully and appropriately
- give clear instructions regarding use and valid inputs

***

## UX &#8722; User Experience Design

### User Requirements

Some example user stories which will affect the design

#### First Time User

> *"As a programmer, I would like to test my knowledge"*
>
> *"As a quiz fanatic, I would like to know how I compare with other users"*
>
> *"As someone who hasn't used a CLI before, I would like to know my inputs
> are valid"*

#### Returning User

> *"As a returning user, I would like to see a list of high-scores"*
>
> *"I would like to know if my scores are in the high-scores list"*
>
> *"If I return to play again, I would like to play different questions"*

#### Interested Party

> *"As someone interested in how the application has been made, I am interested
> to see how user inputs have been validated and errors have been handled"*

***

### Initial Concept

I intend to make a quiz application based around the popular television quiz
show *'Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?'*. I anticipate using a pre-populated API
for the questions and answers, using a 'level of difficulty' selection built in
to the API. I also intend to have a couple of 'life-line' options available to
the user. Finally, I would like to implement a high-score spreadsheet
maintained via Google Sheets.

### Features Left to Implement

1. Even The Odds
   - *This will allow users to remove 2 incorrect answers*
   - If a user inputs a keyword, they will be presented with the question and
    only 2 answers, one of which will be correct. This will only be allowed once
    during each play.

2. Call A Coder
   - *This will allow users to receive some advice from an ersatz friend*
   - If a user requires assistance on a question, they may input a keyword that
    generates a simulated response from another coder. The response received
    may not be correct. I intend to scale this depending on the current
    question number.

3. Request A Review
   - *This will allow users to pose the question to a pseudo panel of
    spectators*
   - If a user is struggling with an answer, they may request assistance from a
     spurious audience. The responses received may not be correct. I intend to
     scale this depending on the current question number.

### Python Packages

- random
  - shuffle: used to generate random ordering
  - randrange: returns a random integer within a given range
- html

- time
  - sleep: stalls the program for a defined time
- requests: enables data retrieval from APIs
- gspread: allows communication with Google Sheets
- from google.oauth2.service_account
  - Credentials: used to validate credentials and grant access to google
    service accounts
- better_profanity
  - profanity: simple profanity checker
